# Detailed Technical Specification — Epi-Flipboard

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objective

Develop a web and mobile-first content aggregation and reading platform inspired by Flipboard, enabling users to:

* Access articles from multiple sources (RSS, APIs, web scraping)
* Personalize their content feed by topics of interest
* Save articles for later reading
* Share content easily
* Enjoy a smooth, immersive, and responsive magazine-like experience

### 1.2 Key Goals

* Centralize reliable and diverse information sources.
* Provide an elegant, fast, and personalized user experience.
* Demonstrate the technical feasibility of a scalable, automated content aggregator.
* Lay the foundation for future extensions: AI-based recommendations, analytics, offline mode, and social features.

## 3. Technical Constraints

### 3.1 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Vite + React Router + TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** Express.js with REST APIs + Mongoose ODM
* **Database:** MongoDB (Local development → MongoDB Atlas for production)
* **Content Sources:** RSS Feeds (Le Monde, Le Figaro, France Info, RFI, L'Express) + Optional APIs (NewsAPI, Guardian, NY Times)
* **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer for JavaScript-heavy sites (Autonews, Jeune Afrique)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
* **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend + Backend)

### 3.2 Security

* **Authentication:**
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
  - JWT tokens (7-day expiration)
  - OAuth 2.0 (Google & Facebook integration)
* **API Security:**
  - JWT verification middleware for protected routes
  - CORS configured with whitelist (localhost + production domains)
  - Bearer token authentication header
* **Transport Security:**
  - HTTPS mandatory in production (Vercel automatically managed)
  - Secure environment variables (.env excluded from Git)
* **Data Protection:**
  - MongoDB connection secured with credentials
  - API keys stored in environment variables only
  - No sensitive data in frontend code

## 5. Data Architecture (Simplified)

**Main Tables:**

* users(id, email, password_hash, prefs jsonb, created_at)
* sources(id, url, category, enabled, last_fetch)
* articles(id, source_id, title, summary, url, content_html, published_at, meta jsonb)
* favorites(user_id, article_id, created_at)
* user_activity(user_id, event_type, data jsonb, created_at)

## 6. Project Workflow & Methodology

### 6.2 Development Tools

* **GitHub:** version control and CI/CD.
* **ESLint / Prettier / Husky:** code quality.
* **Jest / Playwright:** unit and end-to-end testing.
* **Docker Compose:** local development setup.

### 6.3 CI/CD Workflow

1. Push to branch -> lint + test + build.
2. Auto-deploy with Vercel.
