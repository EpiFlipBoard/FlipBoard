* Share content easily
* Enjoy a smooth, immersive, and responsive magazine-like experience

### 1.2 Key Goals

* Centralize reliable and diverse information sources.
* Provide an elegant, fast, and personalized user experience.
* Demonstrate the technical feasibility of a scalable, automated content aggregator.
* Lay the foundation for future extensions: AI-based recommendations, analytics, offline mode, and social features.

## 4. Software Architecture

### 4.1 Components

1. **Frontend (Next.js):** Responsive UI, SSR/ISR for SEO, integrates API.
2. **API Gateway (NestJS):** Exposes endpoints for users, feed, favorites.
3. **Ingestion Service:** Microservice dedicated to fetching and parsing feeds.
4. **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka to orchestrate ingestion.
5. **Database & Search:** PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch.
6. **Storage:** MinIO / S3 for images and archived articles.
7. **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki.

### 4.2 Conceptual Diagram

## 5. Data Architecture (Simplified)

**Main Tables:**

* `users(id, email, password_hash, prefs jsonb, created_at)`
* `sources(id, url, category, enabled, last_fetch)`
* `articles(id, source_id, title, summary, url, content_html, published_at, meta jsonb)`
* `favorites(user_id, article_id, created_at)`
* `user_activity(user_id, event_type, data jsonb, created_at)`

## 6. Project Workflow & Methodology

### 6.1 Management Methodology

* **Agile (Scrum)** — 2-week sprints, daily standups, retrospectives.
* **Tools:** Jira / Linear for project management, Notion / Confluence for documentation.
* **Communication:** Slack with CI/CD and Sentry integrations.

### 6.2 Development Tools

* **GitHub:** version control and CI/CD.
* **ESLint / Prettier / Husky:** code quality.
* **Jest / Playwright:** unit and end-to-end testing.
* **Docker Compose:** local development setup.

### 6.3 CI/CD Workflow

1. Push to branch → lint + test + build.
2. Merge PR → build Docker image and push to registry.
3. Auto-deploy to staging.
4. Manual approval before production release.
